# 🎵 Music Genre Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a robust music genre classification system using deep learning techniques and the GTZAN dataset. By converting raw audio signals into spectrograms and training a neural network, we aim to accurately classify music tracks into one of 10 predefined genres.

## 📁 Dataset

**GTZAN Genre Collection**  
- 10 genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock  
- 100 tracks per genre  
- Each track is 30 seconds long  
- Dataset Reference: *Tzanetakis & Cook, 2002*
